= pcap - a binding to libpcap

libpcap is the library behind the commonly use tcpdump utility. It allows
reading packet captures live from a network, as well as reading and writing
saved packet captures in "pcap" format. It has been ported to many operating
systems.

It doesn't implement the full libpcap interface, just what we've needed so far.

To build, see Makefile, it has only been used on Linux and OS X so far.

To decode the packets, you might want to use the lua bindings I've added to libnet, 
see the lua/ subdirectory of <https://github.com/sam-github/libnet>.


<https://github.com/javierguerragiraldez/pcaplua> is an alternative binding, it
supports a slightly different sub-sets of libpcap. Also, it has tcp/ip parsing
functions, whereas I use libnet for that.

I'm happy to take patches, of course, and might even add a feature if its easy.
