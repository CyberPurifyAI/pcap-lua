= pcap - a binding to libpcap

libpcap is the library behind the commonly use tcpdump utility. It allows
reading packet captures live from a network, as well as reading and writing
saved packet captures in "pcap" format. It has been ported to many operating
systems.

The binding doesn't implement the full libpcap API, just what we've needed so
far.

To build, see Makefile, it supports FreeBSD, Linux and OS X.

To decode the packets, you might want to use libnet's lua bindings, see the
lua/ subdirectory of <https://github.com/sam-github/libnet>.

If this doesn't do what you need,
<https://github.com/javierguerragiraldez/pcaplua> is a binding to a different
subset of libpcap's API. Also, it has tcp/ip parsing functions, whereas we use
libnet for that.
